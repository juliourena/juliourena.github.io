2020 came with many surprises for everyone, COVID, social distancing, remote work and PlainText decided to take a break from their RedTeam learning journey to learn a few things about BlueTeam.

And so it was, while I was looking at Twitter I came across the [tweet](https://twitter.com/takito1812/status/1310834159909326848?s=20) of my friend Víctor García [Takito](https://twitter.com/takito1812), talking about the #100DaysOfCode challenge, I found it super interesting, since I am a person who likes challenges, and I thought it appropriate to use this methodology to learn about BlueTeam. It was then that I decided to apply the #100DaysOfCode rules to my own #100DaysOfBlueTeam challenge.

The challenge basically consisted of dedicating at least 1 hour a day to learn something related to BlueTeam, [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) you can see the rules for the original challenge. My initial idea was to learn about threat detection, mainly for Windows environments, learn about YARA/Sigma rules, and see what other things came along the way.

On October 10, 2020, I started the challenge by posting my first [tweet](https://twitter.com/JulioUrena/status/1314967665967091713?s=20) and started this learning journey that I do not regret.

In my [GitHub](https://github.com/juliourena/100DaysOfBlueTeam) I shared different use cases of the things I learned during the challenge, so that you can use it as a reference. I realized that I dedicated much more time understanding how to collect information, what tools I can use for different needs and automate all processes, than analyzing the information itself.

As part of these tasks, I learned to automate my labs, different tools for collecting information, and many OpenSource tools, which in my opinion are great and really useful for learning to identify threats.

I know that this knowledge will allow me to generally improve my perspectives in relation to Cybersecurity issues, knowledge that I hope to be able to apply and share in the future.
